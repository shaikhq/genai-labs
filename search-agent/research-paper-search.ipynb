    "* Accepts a user prompt describing a research topic.\n",
    "* Uses **Watsonx.ai LLM** to identify the relevant research domain (e.g., NLP, ML).\n",
    "* Searches online repositories like **arXiv** for recent, relevant papers.\n",
    "* Returns the top three papers with abstracts.\n",
    "* On request, summarizes the papers using **LLM summarization tools**.\n",
    "* Built with **LangGraph**, enabling multi-step planning and tool usage via the **ReAct pattern**.\n",
    "* Hosted and orchestrated via **Watsonx.ai** services.\n",

      "   - **Abstract**: High quality SQL corpus is essential for intelligent database. For example, Text-to-SQL requires SQL queries and correspond natural language questions as training samples. However, collecting such query corpus remains challenging in practice due to the high cost of manual annotation, which highlights the importance of automatic SQL generation. Despite recent advances, existing generation methods still face limitations in achieving both diversity and cost-effectiveness. Besides, many methods also treat all tables equally, which overlooks schema complexity and leads to under-utilization of structurally rich tables. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent \n",

      "   - This paper proposes a multi-agent framework, SQL-Factory, for high-quality and large-scale SQL generation. It decomposes the generation process into three collaborative teams: Generation Team, Expansion Team, and Management Team. The framework ensures a balanced trade-off between diversity, scalability, and generation cost.\n",

It proposes two effective pruning methods, keyword set and aggregated neighbor difference lower bound pruning, to reduce the S3AND search space. The paper also presents an effective indexing mechanism for efficient S3AND query answering.\n",

It proposes a unified index to organize data reasonably and remove outliers in datasets, improving query efficiency.

It decomposes the generation process into three collaborative teams: Generation Team, Expansion Team, and Management Team. The framework ensures a balanced trade-off between diversity, scalability, and generation cost. SQL-Factory generates over 300,000 SQL queries with less than $200 API cost, achieving higher diversity compared to other methods and significantly improving model performance in various downstream tasks.\n",

It proposes two effective pruning methods, keyword set and aggregated neighbor difference lower bound pruning, to reduce the S3AND search space.

The experimental evaluation using six spatial data repositories shows that Spadas achieves orders of magnitude faster query efficiency than state-of-the-art algorithms.\n",
